## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I was feeling addictive to 
```
random-name{
  position:absolute;
  left:50%;
  top: 50%;
  transform:translate(-50%;-50%)
}
```
This code makes the .random-name both horizontally and vertically centered. I used this so much that it starting to feel like cheesy. So I tried a different approach and put .random-name inside a container then used flex to center everything. I'll keep using this strategy until it gives cheese vibe.
